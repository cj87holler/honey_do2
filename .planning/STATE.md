# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-23)

**Core value:** People in a household can assign tasks to each other and actually get them done, because the gamified bee-themed experience makes chores feel like play rather than nagging.
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.1 — Landing Page & Polish

## Current Position

Phase: 07
Plan: Not started
Status: Roadmap ready, awaiting phase planning
Last activity: 2026-04-24

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Carried from v1.0:

- Stack: Next.js 15 App Router + Drizzle ORM + Better Auth 1.5.6 + PostgreSQL (Neon for deploy)
- Schema: Honey counter is stored per-Hive-membership (not globally) to support future Colonies without migration
- Deployment: Neon-Vercel integration, conditional driver switching for local/prod

### Pending Todos

- **UAT: No leave-hive feature** — users blocked from joining partner's hive because single-hive enforcement has no exit path. Addressed in Phase 8. See `.planning/todos/pending/uat-multi-hive-block.md`
- **UAT: Feature requests** — due dates (addressed in Phase 8), welcome email, task descriptions, task categories/tags, calendar integration. See `.planning/todos/pending/uat-feature-requests.md`
- **UAT: Admin dashboard** — Addressed in Phase 9. See `.planning/todos/pending/uat-admin-dashboard.md`

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
